# 8-Star-Wars-API

This App is rich in data and it's give me a lot's of practice with API. I used Star Wars API.
App make requests for fetching data and make additional request to get even more informaton from API

## Impemented features:
Loads categories from API and dynamically create clickable elements. By clicking on the category we see clickable lists of first 10 items data.
I applied pagination for lists greater than 10 items. 
I added some styles to data on selected items of that array. Once you select any of the items here from the list, it's going to output the contents contained some styles.
Also if it is an array, app able to detect that and what we're doing is we're just stringifyingthe contents of the array.  


Unpretentious style included!
